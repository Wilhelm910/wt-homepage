            <p>I am a Front-end developer based in Munich, Germany. I enjoy helping designers and companies bring their
                ideas
                into real life. I am looking forward to continuing my developer career with a job in a junior web
                developer
                position.<br><br> If you think I’d be a good match for your projects, contact me!</p>
